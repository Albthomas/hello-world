# hello-world

Hello!

My name is Albert. I'm a Computer Engineering student at Stony Brook University. I have experience in Java, C++, and AVR Assembly but I am also trying to learn about several other languages including Arduino and Python. I plan to use this platform to post about my past and current projects.
